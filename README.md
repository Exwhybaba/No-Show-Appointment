# No-Show-Appointment
 Medical-Appointments-Data-Analysis
This is my first project in the Udacity/Alx Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

Dataset
The project focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointments as well as the factors that are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment. The dataset (No-show appointments) collects information from 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. The data set was used to answer the following question:
1. How does the age of a patient affect their likelihood of showing up or not?
2. What gender tends to show up more?
3. Do the patients who got scholarships tend to show up more?
4. Is there any relationship between missing the appointment and not receiving an SMS message?

Summary of the Findings
After the analysis, the following insights were revealed:
1. Patients who fall into the category of 60–80 tend to show up for their appointments, while patients who fall into the category of 20–40 are liable to not show up for their appointments.
2. There is no relationship between not showing up for the appointment and gender, as there is no huge difference between a male and a female who did not show up. We can't say which of the genders tends to show up.
3. Patients who did not receive sponsorship had a 1% no-show rate compared to patients who did receive sponsorship. The scholarship has no significant
4. People who received SMS and missed their appointment were 10.8% more likely to miss their appointment than those who did not receive SMS and missed their appointment. Therefore, the SMS has no significance.
5. We can also conclude that the age group 60–80 has the highest number of patients with diabetes, hypertension, and alcoholism than any other age group, which may explain why they do not miss their appointments scheduled after 80–110.

Key Insights for Presentation
During the process of exploration, I showed the relationship between the different age groups and diabetes, alcoholism, and hypertension to determine which of the age categories had the highest levels of diabetes, alcoholism, and hypertension using bar chat. I also determined which of the age categories had the highest count.
I also determined the waiting period by subtracting the appointment date from the scheduled date, making use of the histogram to show the difference. I also used line chat to determine when the scheduled date starts and when the appointment date starts. I also showed the relationship between the scheduled date and the appointment date using a scatter plot.
I also determine which gender has the highest count using a pie chart.
